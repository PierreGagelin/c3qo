# TODO of c3qo project

This file contains some ideas of things to do

## Dev

- use doxygen
- try ASIO library for sockets
- modify block configuration interface to take two strings (to do key:value pair configuration)
- add a protobuf message to terminate the application
- modify monitoring socket address to be configurable
- retrieve full path to script from "readlink -f" instead of $0 and pwd
- send confirmation when configured from network CLI

## Integration

- look at code "TODO:"
- setup tests with Docker
