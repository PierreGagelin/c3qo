# TODO of c3qo project

This file contains some ideas of things to do

## Environment

- build external projects (protobuf, zmq) with CMake and offline
- use doxygen

## Dev

- add a protobuf message to terminate the application
- implement a queue to send messages in hook
- reuse ZeroMQ hook inside network CLI (there should be no reason to keep utils/socket library)
- implement a buffer management

## Integration

- setup tests with Docker
