# TODO of c3qo project

This file contains some ideas of things to do

## Dev

- use doxygen
- try ASIO library for sockets
- modify block configuration interface to take two strings (to do key:value pair configuration)
- add a protobuf message to terminate the application
- modify monitoring socket address to be configurable

## Integration

- do real functional tests (at the moment there is no verifications)
- setup functional tests with robot framework
- setup tests with Docker
